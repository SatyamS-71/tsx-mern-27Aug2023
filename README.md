# Task Completed - 
✅- For every user, we’d like to display a card with the name of each character along with a random picture for each character (see [Picsum photos](https://picsum.photos/) for random picture inspiration, **hint**: Hit refresh and you will  get new pic).

✅- Each character card should be colored based on their species and have some kind of animation when the user hovers over the card.

✅- When we click on a character’s card, more information should appear in a modal about the character.

✅- In the character details modal, we’d like to display information about the person: name as the header of the modal, height displayed in meters, mass in kg, date person was added to the API (in dd-MM-yyyy format), number of films the person appears in and their birth year.

✅- We should also fetch information about the person’s homeworld and display its name, terrain, climate, and amount of residents.

✅- Adder filter functionality.
